# simple-ml-rounding
A very small machine learning project built from scratch in Python.
The model learns how to round floating-point numbers using a basic training loop and gradient descent.
This project was created purely for learning purposes.
Note: Bias is fixed to zero to keep the rounding threshold stable.
